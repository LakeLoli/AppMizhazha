AppMizhazha
===========

Mizhazha is a prototype of a Snapchat-like self-destructing photo messaging Android application. Using the application, users can chat with each other by sending photo and video messages, which will be self-destructed in 10 seconds after seen by recipients. The messages are regarded as "Mi"s, and the action of self-destruction is regarded as "zhazha". That's where the App name comes from.

I followed a tutorial and made the app step by step, starting from a single Activity to finally publishing it at Google Play.
